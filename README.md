# CRUD Application with Java, Servlets, Tomcat, and MySQL

This repository contains a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application developed using Java, Servlets, Tomcat, and a MySQL database. The application allows you to perform operations on "user" and "company" records and includes a filter to prevent unauthorized access.

## Overview

- The CRUD application is designed for performing operations on user and company records stored in a MySQL database.

- Manual creation of "user" and "company" tables in the MySQL database was required, including defining their structure and column details.

- Data manipulation with these tables is done manually using MySQL queries, including operations like insertion, updating, retrieval, and deletion by writing SQL queries.

- A filter has been implemented to restrict unauthorized users from accessing specific parts of the application. Filters are commonly used in Java web applications for tasks such as authentication, authorization, and request preprocessing.
